            <div class="line"></div>
            <br>
            <p> My hobby is doing sketches and love doing it my free time. Whenever I go home I like to do sketches after doing it I like to do homework. I am 12 years old and I am in 7th standard. Now I know that reading is very good habit that make me complete. This hobby can be developed by anyone however I got this naturally. Sketches keeps obe always happy and busy. It is a good source of enjoyment and make your creativity more. </p>

            <p>A sketch is a rapidly executed freehand drawing that is not usually intended as a finished work. A sketch may serve a number of purposes: it might record something that the artist sees, it might record or develop an idea for later use or it might be used as a quick way of graphically demonstrating an image, idea or principle. Sketching is the most inexpensive art medium.
                <br>
Sketches can be made in any drawing medium. The term is most often applied to graphic work executed in a dry medium such as silverpoint, graphite, pencil, charcoal or pastel. It may also apply to drawings executed in pen and ink, digital input such as a digital pen, ballpoint pen, marker pen, water colour and oil paint. The latter two are generally referred to as "water colour sketches" and "oil sketches". A sculptor might model three-dimensional sketches in clay, plasticine or wax.
                <br>
                Sketching is generally a prescribed part of the studies of art students. This generally includes making sketches , from a live model whose pose changes every few minutes. A "sketch" usually implies a quick and loosely drawn work, while related terms such as study, modello and "preparatory drawing" usually refer to more finished and careful works to be used as a basis for a final work, often in a different medium, but the distinction is imprecise. Underdrawing is drawing underneath the final work, which may sometimes still be visible, or can be viewed by modern scientific methods such as X-rays.
                <br>
Most visual artists use, to a greater or lesser degree, the sketch as a method of recording or working out ideas. The sketchbooks of some individual artists have become very well known, including those of Leonardo da Vinci and Edgar Degas which have become art objects in their own right, with many pages showing finished studies as well as sketches. The term "sketchbook" refers to a book of blank paper on which an artist can draw sketches. The book might be purchased bound or might comprise loose leaves of sketches assembled or bound together.
                <br>
Sketching is also used as a form of communication in areas of product design such as industrial design. It can be used to communicate design intent and is most widely used in ideation. It can be used to map out floor plans of homes.
                <br>
The ability to quickly record impressions through sketching has found varied purposes in today's culture. Courtroom sketches record scenes and individuals in law courts. Sketches drawn to help authorities find or identify wanted people are called composite sketches. Street artists in popular tourist areas sketch portraits within minutes.

            <h1>ADVANTAGES OF SKETCHING</h1>
            <div class="line"></div>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>Hobbies are a great way to relax and unwind after a busy day at the office. They can take your mind off anything that is stressing you out, and are a great way to enjoy yourself and let your mind rest. Drawing and sketching are great hobbies that you can do at any time.  Sketching and drawing is a great way to improve your creative skills and start thinking in a different way. Art shows you that there is normally more than one way to solve a problem. Art encourages open minded thinking and creativity. <br>These can be really helpful for personal development and solving problems. Skills you learn through sketching can be applied in a number of different areas in your life. Sketching helps develop a number of different areas of your brain. You develop your ability to focus and pay attention, a skill that can be very useful throughout your life and career. It also develops hand-eye coordination so that everyday tasks can become easier for you. But it also develops strategic thinking, a concept that can be useful to everyone. <br>Sketching can even improve your holistic health. As you build your self esteem and confidence through your art and your sketches as you become better and better. You will get a sense of achievement and start feeling proud of your art which you will carry that confidence through to the rest of your life. Having confidence in your work -whatever it is- is an incredibly useful thing to have. Rest and relaxation is one of the main advantages of sketching, as a hobby. <br>Sketching allows you to sit back and sketch a picture at your own pace. There are no rules and no one telling you what to do, you can just draw whatever you want and have fun while doing it. Sketching can also help you improve your communication skills. Because there are no words in a drawing, well, most of the time, the artist finds other ways to communicate with the audience. This can help you improve your other communication skills by better understanding your feelings and emotions and without the need for words to be spoken.</p>
